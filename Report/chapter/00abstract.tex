Multi-agent block transportation is a problem that has been used as a way to compare different machine learning algorithms. While Q-learning is an algorithm that has proven to be very successful at single agent tasks, team Q-learning might be better at tasks where agents have to use coordination. In this study we used the multi-agent box transportation task to compare the performances of the Q-learning and team Q-learning algorithms. We created a simulation in which two agents have to move a block to a goal area, using one of these algorithms. Results showed that, while single agent Q-learning finds a more optimal path for the agents to reach the block, the team Q-learning algorithm is considerably faster in finding a good solution for transporting the block to the goal area.
