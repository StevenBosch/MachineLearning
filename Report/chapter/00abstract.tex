Multi-agent block transportation is a problem that has been used as a way to compare different machine learning algortihms. It can be complicated because agents have to find a way to cooperatively execute a task in an unknown environment. In this paper, we will use this task to compare the performances of the Q-learning and team Q-learning algorithms. While Q-learning is an algorithm that has previously been very succesful, team Q-learning might be better at tasks where agents have to use coordination. To test the performances of the algorithms, we created a simulation in which two agents have to move a block to a goal area. \textbf{ADD SOMETHING ABOUT RESULTS}
