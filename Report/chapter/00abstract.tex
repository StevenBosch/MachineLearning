Multi-agent block transportation is a problem that has been used as a way to compare different machine learning algorithms. While Q-learning is an algorithm that has proven to be very successful at single agent tasks, team Q-learning might be better at tasks where agents have to use coordination. In this study we used the multi-agent box transportation task to compare the performances of the Q-learning and team Q-learning algorithms. We created a simulation in which two agents have to move a block to a goal area, using either classical (single agent) Q-learning or team Q-learning. Results showed that, while single agent Q-learning finds a more optimal path for the agents to reach the block, the team Q-learning algorithm finds the path of the agents transporting the block the target area much faster.
